                <p class="mt-4"><span class="text-xl font-semibold">Ans : </span>Using map on an array takes each element of the array one by one and performs the operation given in the map on each element and displays the result in an array. <br>
                 On the other hand forEach and map do exactly the same thing but forEach does not return any result.
                <br>
                Using filter on an array check every element like map. A filter contains a condition. The elements that meet that condition are displayed as results.
                <br>
                Find performs like same as filter. However like  filter instead of showing every element that meets the condition as a result, only the first element that meets the condition is shown as the result.
