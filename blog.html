                <p class="mt-4"><span class="text-xl font-semibold">Ans : </span>Using map on an array takes each element of the array one by one and performs the operation given in the map on each element and displays the result in an array. <br>
                 On the other hand forEach and map do exactly the same thing but forEach does not return any result.
                <br>
                Using filter on an array check every element like map. A filter contains a condition. The elements that meet that condition are displayed as results.
                <br>
                Find performs like same as filter. However like  filter instead of showing every element that meets the condition as a result, only the first element that meets the condition is shown as the result.

                <p class="mt-4"><span class="text-xl font-semibold">Ans : </span>What a user has done while using a website is stored in the localStorage of that website until someone deletes the data manually.
                <br>
                SessionStorage stores user data like localStorage. However, once the user reloads or closes that website, all data is deleted from SessionStorage.

                By setting cookies on a website, the user's information is stored on the website. Through this, if the user exits the website and enters again, it can easily recognize the user through the cookies of the website user and show him the necessary data. Sometimes the website gives the user's information to the third party website through cookies. That's why when we see some products on a website and enter Facebook, we also see this related product there. Here Facebook fetches cookies from that website and gives the result according to what the user wants to see

                <p class="mt-10 text-2xl font-semibold text-center"><u>What is event loop . How does it work</u></p>
                <p class="mt-4"><span class="text-xl font-semibold">Ans : </span>We do something inside a function and return it. In addition to this, many other functions in that function can be called serially according to one's own way by event loop. Calling a function will create a loop. When the function gives a result, if something is returned in that function, then if a function is called, then the work done in that function is also shown as a result. In this way, if you want to show multiple results, call different functions through a function through a loop and get their results, and by calling a function, combine many tasks together and give the result.
